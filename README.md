# MVVM
this is a visio for MVVM Architecture Pattern.
Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view)
– be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any
specific model platfor.
